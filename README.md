# Hello! I'm Taneesha :)

🎓 Senior at **UCLA** studying **Mathematics & Economics**  
🏦 Incoming Associate, **Associate Development Program @ Silicon Valley Bank**   

----


I’m interested in how **capital, technology, and data** shape the innovation economy.

I’ll be starting my career in **innovation banking at SVB**, working closely with venture-backed startups and high-growth companies. Over time, I’m looking to move closer to the **product and decision-making layer** through roles in **fintech, strategic finance, or AI startups** that value strong financial fundamentals, curiosity, and ownership.

My background in **math, economics, and analytics** helps me think rigorously about **incentives, risk, and scale**, and I enjoy turning complex problems into clear models and insights.
